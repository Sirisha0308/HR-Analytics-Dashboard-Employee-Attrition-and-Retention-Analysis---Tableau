This project analyzes employee attrition patterns using HR data to help organizations improve retention strategies.
Built in Tableau Public, the dashboard visualizes key HR metrics such as Total Employees, Attrition Count, Attrition Rate, Average Age, Average Monthly Income, and Average Years at Company.

The dataset includes demographic details (age, gender, department, job role), employment history, and salary information.
Key visualizations include Attrition by Gender, Department, Job Role, Income by Role, and Years at Company vs Attrition.

Insights from the analysis reveal that certain departments and job roles have higher turnover, lower salaries correlate with higher attrition, and employees often leave within the early years of employment.
The dashboard provides interactive filters and comparative views, enabling HR teams to make data-driven decisions for workforce planning.

This tool helps HR managers identify problem areas, monitor workforce trends, and create targeted retention programs effectively.
